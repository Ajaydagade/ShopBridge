I have created two projects 

I)ShopBridgeApp(Use 
ShopBridge repository project )
II)ShopBridgeAPI(Please use ShopBridgeAPI repository)



I have created ShopBridge Web application.Here I have covered the following points.
 
 1. Add a new item to the inventory (The item should require a name, description, and price 
as basic fileds, think of additional information that would be useful)
2. Modify an item in the inventory.
3. Delete an item from the inventory.
4. Lists the items in the inventory.



ShopBridgeApp:
This is the web application,and i have consume the web api api in this project for performing db related operations.

Example(Screenshots):
